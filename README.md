In this group project, my role was to analysis the death rate in the UK and make a prediction of how many deaths there would be between 2022 and 2040.

First I found data from 2008 - 2021 which I could plot and determine a line of best fit but also taking into account that deaths in 2019 - 2020 could be an outlier due to COVID - 19. This gave a basic prediction for the future:

I then took into other factors like age expectancy and the average age of people in the UK to create a much better model for my final prediction.
